			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<article>
				<h4>Skyeng Online School</h4>
				<p>
				It was my first official work experience. I was working as an English tutor in an online school Skyeng. I was responsible for delivering lessons for General English learners of different levels and ages. Apart from teaching skills, I have learned time management and strong communication skills. I have also developed interpersonal skills as I needed to create a bond with students to ensure their effective learning.

				<h4>SmarTestPrep Center</h4>
				<p>
				I have also worked as English tutor offline and was responsible for the preparation of students to the IELTS exam. My work experience involved creating lesson plans, delivering lessons, as well as grading assignments, and communicating with parents if needed. This experience helped me to develop skills in lesson planning, student assessment, and classroom management. I also had an opportunity to work with new colleagues and develop positive team environment.

				<h4>Delve Camp</h4>
				<p>
				  Last summer I have also worked in summer camp back in my hometown. The camp was created to help children learn English more effectively through the language-immersion method. I was responsible for the creation and leading of games and exercises to imrpove campers' English skills. I was also involved in organizing recreational activities and ensuring the safety of kids. This work helped me gain experience in teaching English in a new fun and dynamic environment. I have learned to adapt quickly and work with kids.

				<p>I try to volunteer when I have free time. For the past 1,5 years I have participated in folowing club activities: tutoring school students from poor family backgrounds, visiting and volunteering at a local shelter, giving lessons and playing games with children from orphanage. There have also been events such as business forums, concerts, and graduation last year. Participating in club activities helped me gain new experiences and even provided a sense of personal fulfillment from helping others.</p>

				<p>Our university has convenient sport facilities such as swimming pool. I like swimming in the morning and clearing up my mind before an important event later that day, as well as swimming in the evening to relax after a tiring day. I think it is important to keep body healthy and engage in sports activities. </p>
